Project Title: Examining the Effects of ADAS on Driving Behaviour Under Indian Driving Conditions

Funded by: Volvo Group India Private Ltd. and CiSTUP, IISc

Duration: 2023-2025

Project Acronym: ADAS-Effect

Project Description: The usefulness of ADAS or advanced driver warning systems under Heterogeneous Disordered Traffic (HDT) conditions is still not well understood in scientific literature. Too many ADAS warnings can have detrimental effects on drivers’ behaviour, particularly when driving larger vehicles (like buses) under densely packed HDT conditions, like on Indian roads. This work will allow us to optimize ADAS for Indian drivers and traffic conditions, reducing driver fatigue and making the drivers more aware of their surroundings, thus improving the overall road safety of bus drivers. For BMTC (Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation), this will allow them to understand the best ADAS warnings and modalities for their bus drivers.

Project Title: Simultaneous optimization towards smooth traffic flow in an Urban environment

Funded by: Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL)

Duration: 2023-2025

Project Acronym: Traffic-Flow-Optimizer

Project Description: In the era of rapid urbanization driving globalization, the emphasis on smart cities has become central to this process. India, as a developing nation, is poised to construct a significant number of smart cities. However, the pressing challenge remains in designing and implementing an intelligent traffic management system, particularly in densely populated and chaotic traffic scenarios like those in India. The escalating traffic congestion, fuel consumption, and economic losses have underscored the urgent need for an efficient traffic control paradigm. Traditional traffic control methods with signal transitions have proven inadequate, necessitating a paradigm shift towards an automated traffic management system. Considering these aspects, this project aims to develop an innovative data-driven traffic control solution for a selected Indian city, targeting around 40 to 50 major traffic intersections, with the primary objective of ensuring a seamless and optimized traffic flow.

Project Title: Deep Clustering based on Self-Supervised Learning for Visual Cluster Structure Assessment

Funded by: Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF, previously SERB)

Duration: 2023-2025

Project Acronym: Deep-Clustering

Project Description: Clustering is an important unsupervised learning approach for (unlabelled) data mining that partitions the data into groups with similar objects to discover interesting patterns from the dataset. Deep learning-based clustering techniques have recently gained popularity due to their ability to handle complex high-dimensional data. However, these algorithms have limitations, such as the need to specify the number of clusters explicitly beforehand, the lack of information about the inherent cluster structure of data points, and difficulties in interpreting the neural network’s predictions. To overcome these limitations, researchers have used visual assessment of clustering tendency (VAT) methods to estimate the number of clusters present in data. However, these methods are not practical and are often inconclusive with high-dimensional datasets which is the case in most real-life data. Therefore, this project aims to develop an explainable, self-supervised learning-based visual-analytical framework for cluster structure assessment to discover the deep structures present in complex, high-dimensional data when no ground truths are available.
